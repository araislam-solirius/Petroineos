# Project Design Overview: Delta Tables and Spark Optimization

### Introduction
If I were to reimplement this project using Apache Spark and Delta Lake, the design would focus on optimizing for efficient data storage and query performance. Currently, the approach used for this project simply adds new files with the latest data, but I think there's room for improvement. Specifically, we could reduce storage overhead by adopting Delta Lake tables, which would allow for more flexible updates and better data management.

## Key Difference: Delta Table vs. Current Approach

### Current Approach
Right now, every new file downloaded adds the latest data to the system, which creates additional storage and redundancy. Each file contains all the data, plus one new column for the latest quarter.

### Delta Table Approach
Instead of creating new files each time, I would use a Delta Table to simply update the existing data by appending the new quarter as an additional column. This approach would not only save storage space but also streamline the querying process, as all historical data and new data would be centralized in a single Delta table.

### Design with Delta Tables
In the Delta Table approach, each file would be ingested and, instead of saving a new file for every update, the table would be updated with just the new data. This means:

The table would grow only with new columns for each quarter, not entirely new files.
Data for previous quarters remains in place, preventing unnecessary duplication.
Storage overhead is minimized because the entire dataset isn’t being rewritten—just the new columns.

### Storage Efficiency

With Delta Lake, only the additional quarter (as a new column) would be appended. This contrasts with the current approach where a new file containing the full dataset plus one new column is created, leading to a lot of redundant data.

Delta Lake’s columnar storage format means that Spark can store and query specific columns efficiently. By only adding the new column for the latest quarter, storage requirements will be significantly reduced.

### Read and Write Patterns

Most queries will likely be time-range queries or based on specific columns like the quarter. To optimize for this:

Partitioning: I would partition the Delta Table based on the quarter or time-related columns. This would make time-range queries extremely efficient as only the relevant partitions would need to be scanned.
Z-Ordering: For columns that are frequently filtered on (e.g., by region or category), I would use Z-Ordering to cluster the data, which helps with faster filtering.

Data ingestion would happen as new quarterly data becomes available. Each quarter, rather than appending a new file:

The new quarter’s column would be added to the Delta Table.
Writes would be handled in batches for efficiency, and I'd use Delta Lake's built-in ACID transactions to ensure consistency during concurrent reads and writes.
Handling Concurrency
Delta Lake’s snapshot isolation ensures that readers always see a consistent view of the data, even as new data is being written. Multiple users can query the table concurrently without interference, and there’s no need to worry about data consistency problems when new data is being ingested.

### Deduplication and Upserts
To handle deduplication and upserts (i.e., updating existing data or inserting new data):

I would use Delta Lake’s MERGE INTO statement. This allows me to match records based on a unique identifier and either update the data or insert a new record.
For each new quarter, I would merge the latest data into the table without duplicating any existing records, ensuring that only new data is appended.

### Delta Live Tables for Pipeline
In this project, I've already used Airflow for orchestrating the pipeline, but with Delta Lake, I would switch to using Delta Live Tables (DLT). Delta Live Tables would allow for automated, scalable, and real-time pipeline orchestration directly within Databricks. This would simplify the process of loading and transforming data, as well as maintaining lineage and dependencies between different datasets.

With Delta Live Tables, every time a new file is downloaded, it would trigger an update to the Delta Table, ensuring that the new quarter's data is immediately available, without having to create additional files.
